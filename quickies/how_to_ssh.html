      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use that Raspberry Pi (RPi) you have collecting dust!</li>
        <li>Learn how to use SSH</li>
        <li>Explore some basic networking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: The Raspberry Pi Foundation has done a great job
        <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/">documenting</a> how to login remotely to your little princess...but for the sake of being thorough
      </p>
      <h3>SSH connection on your local network</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>With your RPi up and running it should have an IP address by this point. We can check the IP by logging in using a monitor or checking the router connecting the RPi to the internet</li>
        <ul><li>You should log into your router using admin priviledges (if you have never done this a quick google search should get you up to speed) and check for devices connected to the router. Some familiar faces shoud be present - one of which should be your RPi.</li></ul>
        <li>With your RPi address in hand you can locally connect to the server using SSH</li>
        <ul><li>SSH in a nutshell is a secure channel within an unsecure network (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">Wikipedia</a>)</li></ul>
        <li>`ssh pi@0.0.0.0` 0.0.0.0 representing your local IP address</li>
        <ul><li>This will prompt you for your password the default password for your RPi is 'raspberry'</li></ul>
        <li>Once logged in this should bring you to the RPi terminal!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Alright you are some hot stuff logging in remotely to your RPi... Now how would you do that when you are not in the Local Area Network (LAN)?</p>
      <h3>SSH connection from anywhere</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The RPi Foundation suggests you use this: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/access-over-Internet/internetaccess.md">weaved</a></li>
        <ul><li>I have nothing against weaved but one of our objectives is to learn some basic networking so this tutorial will do this the manual way</li></ul>
        <li>Bring up you admin page for your local router again and you should see an option for "Port Forwarding" select this option</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Wait...what is "Port Forwarding"?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your router's IP address is what every device on its network uses to access the internet.</li>
        <li>Assuming you have multiple devices how does the router know which device is which?</li>
        <ul><li>Earlier in the tutorial we looked up our RPi IP address - this is how the router can distinguish between devices</li></ul>
        <li>Port forwarding allows requests from a client (in our case an SSH client) to be directed to the correct device on the correct port</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OK...hopefully you kind of git the gist</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Once on the Port Forwarding page we want to add a new item with a type TCP/UDP and enable global port forwarding</li>
        <li>We should use port 22 in the port categoy of our new item</li>
        <ul><li>The RPi and other computers listen on port 22 for incoming SSH requests</li></ul>
        <li>Entering the local IP address we found earlier we have the last data point in order to begin port forwarding to our RPi</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now you should be able to connect to your RPi from anywhere!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Similar to how we logged in before (`ssh pi@0.0.0.0`) now we will use the routers IP address instead of RPi's IP address</li>
        <ul><li>You can now test this out from your LAN</li></ul>
      </ul>
