Go

* Go is a general-purpose language and can be used for anything, but we think it's a great choice to build an API to power your mobile app, to break out a part of an existing app to take advantage of the performance and scalability benefits, or to build a cross-platform command-line tool to distribute to end users.

* Go, or Golang, is a compiled, strongly typed, modern, general-purpose language created by Google. Google stated their goal for creating Go was to answer some of the problems they were seeing in the developing software infrastructure at Google. Go is fully open source but its managers follow a specific set of principles when deciding what is and what is not included in the language going forward.

*

* Some of the benefits listed for Golang by Google include:
 1. Clear dependencies
 2. Clear syntax
 3. Clear semantics
 4. Composition over inheritance
 5. Simplicity provided by the programming model (garbage collection, concurrency)
 6. Easy tooling (the go tool, gofmt, godoc, gofix)

* Who is using it?
 * Google
 * Docker
 * SoundCloud
 * DropBox
 * SendGrid
 * New York Times
 * Heroku

* Why use it?
  1. Learn a strongly typed language
    * Includes dynamic features that could help bridge the gap between scripting languages like Ruby
  2. High performance
  3. Built in concurrency and garbage collection
  4. Great documentation and community
  5.

* Specific examples:
  1. Docker - command-line tools
  2. Parse - API (http://blog.parse.com/learn/how-we-moved-our-api-from-ruby-to-go-and-saved-our-sanity/)
